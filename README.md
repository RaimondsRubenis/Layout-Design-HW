# Layout-Design-HW
Created a copy of the given design using CSS grid

## Notes
Started by copying margins., etc from Figma, later on adjusted it in my own opinion a bit more properly, so because of that some parts might seem a bit chaotic.
Font-sizes taken from figma.

## TODO / Thoughts about improvement
If I would to be improve, I think I should take a bit more time to play around with margins, paddings and other sizes to get a good look & a better SASS structure that would frequently use common sizes for similar elements. Same would go for typography - would reuse 4 font-sizes.
